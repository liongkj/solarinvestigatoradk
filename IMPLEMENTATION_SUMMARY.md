# Solar Investigator ADK Implementation Summary

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive Solar Investigation system using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) integrated with FastAPI. Here's what has been completed:

### ✅ Phase 1: ADK Environment Setup (COMPLETED)

**Task 1.1: Install and Configure ADK**
- ✅ Installed Google ADK Python SDK via `uv add google-adk-python`
- ✅ Updated `pyproject.toml` with ADK dependencies
- ✅ Set up ADK configuration files and environment variables
- ⚠️ Google Cloud credentials setup pending (requires actual GCP project)

**Task 1.2: Create ADK Project Structure**
- ✅ Created complete `backend/src/adk/` directory structure:
  ```
  backend/src/adk/
  ├── agents/              # ✅ ADK agent implementations
  ├── tools/               # ✅ Solar investigation tools
  ├── callbacks/           # ✅ Event callbacks directory
  ├── services/            # ✅ ADK services directory  
  ├── models/              # ✅ Data models

### ✅ Phase 4: FastAPI Integration (COMPLETED)

**Task 4.1: Create ADK-FastAPI Bridge**
- ✅ Integrated ADK with FastAPI using `get_fast_api_app()`
- ✅ Configured automatic agent discovery from `adk/agents` directory
- ✅ Set up database session service with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Configured CORS middleware for frontend communication

**Task 4.2: Implement Investigation Endpoints**
- ✅ `POST /api/investigations/start` - Start new investigation using ADK agent
- ✅ `GET /api/investigations/{id}/stream` - Stream investigation progress via SSE
- ✅ `POST /api/investigations/{id}/interact` - Send messages to running investigation  
- ✅ `GET /api/investigations/{id}/artifacts` - Retrieve investigation artifacts
- ✅ `GET /api/investigations/{id}/status` - Get investigation status
- ✅ `GET /api/investigations` - List all investigations
- ✅ `DELETE /api/investigations/{id}` - Cancel running investigation

**Task 4.3: Maintain Existing API Compatibility**
- ✅ Kept existing REST endpoints (`/`, `/health`, `/api/investigate`)
- ✅ Ensured data models remain compatible with frontend
- ✅ Added ADK-specific fields and state management

### ✅ Phase 5: Investigation Workflow Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Task 5.1: Define Investigation Process**
- ✅ Mapped investigation steps to ADK agent workflow
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive multi-step investigation process:
  1. **Project parameter collection** - Analyze initial request and extract requirements
  2. **Site analysis research** - Evaluate roof conditions, orientation, shading
  3. **Regulatory compliance check** - Research permits, building codes, regulations
  4. **Technical feasibility assessment** - Analyze electrical systems, equipment compatibility
  5. **Cost estimation** - Calculate system costs, incentives, financing options
  6. **Risk analysis** - Identify and assess project risks and mitigation strategies
  7. **Final recommendation generation** - Create comprehensive reports and recommendations

**Task 5.2: Implement Agent-Tool Interactions**
- ✅ Configured agent to use tools in sequence during investigation
- ✅ Set up tool result processing and state updates
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive error handling for tool failures
- ✅ Created investigation checkpoint system with progress tracking

    "project_type": "residential",
    "location": "San Jose, CA"
})

investigation_id = response.json()["investigation_id"]

# Stream real-time progress
async for event in client.get(f"/api/investigations/{investigation_id}/stream"):
    print(f"Progress: {event['message']}")

# Interact with investigation
await client.post(f"/api/investigations/{investigation_id}/interact", json={
