    5. **Final Report**: Provide detailed analysis with actionable insights

    ## Key Performance Ratio Indicators to Monitor

    ### Daily PR Anomalies:
    - **Dramatic PR Drops**: daily_pr_percent drops > 15% from recent averages
    - **Temperature Impact**: Significant difference between daily_pr_percent and daily_pr_temp_corrected_percent
    - **Consistency Issues**: Large day-to-day variations in daily_pr_percent
    - **Seasonal Deviations**: PR values inconsistent with expected seasonal patterns

    ### Correlating Factors:
    - **Availability Impact**: Low daily_availability_percent correlating with PR drops
    - **Soiling Effects**: High plant_soiling_loss_percent affecting PR
    - **Curtailment Issues**: plant_curtailment_kw reducing effective PR
    - **Temperature Effects**: average_cell_temperature_c impact on performance
    - **Radiation Correlation**: PR performance relative to daily_slope_radiation_kwh_m_squared

    ## Anomaly Detection Criteria

    ### Critical PR Issues:
    - Daily PR < 70% during good radiation conditions (>4 kWh/m²/day)
    - Daily PR drops > 20% compared to 7-day rolling average
    - Temperature-corrected PR significantly different from standard PR (>10% difference)
    - Zero or near-zero PR during high radiation periods

    ### Warning Level Issues:
    - Daily PR between 70-80% consistently for >3 consecutive days
    - High soiling losses (> 5%) correlating with PR drops
    - Availability < 95% impacting PR calculations
    - Significant curtailment (>10% of expected generation) affecting PR assessment

    ### Performance Degradation Patterns:
    - Gradual PR decline over extended periods (>2% decline over 30 days)
    - Seasonal PR performance worse than expected
    - Inconsistent PR patterns without clear environmental causes
    - Poor correlation between radiation and yield affecting PR

    ## Analysis Methodology
    1. **Trend Analysis**: Examine daily PR trends over the analysis period using rolling averages
    2. **Benchmark Comparison**: Compare against typical PR ranges (80-90% for well-performing plants)
    3. **Correlation Analysis**: Assess relationships between PR and environmental/operational factors
    4. **Seasonal Adjustment**: Account for expected seasonal PR variations based on temperature patterns
    5. **Temperature Correction Validation**: Compare standard vs temperature-corrected PR
    6. **Root Cause Investigation**: Identify contributing factors (soiling, curtailment, availability)

    ## Quality Assurance Guidelines
    - Do not ignore any problematic PR values
    - Consider both absolute PR values and relative changes
    - Account for weather and seasonal variations
    - Validate temperature correction effectiveness
    - Cross-reference with availability and operational data
    - Assess both short-term anomalies and long-term trends
